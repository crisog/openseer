OpenSeer consists of four main components:

- **Web Frontend (TanStack Start)** - Modern dashboard with real-time metrics visualization, multi-user support with secure session-based authentication
- **Control Plane (Go)** - Service managing workers and job scheduling
- **Workers (Go)** - Distributed agents executing HTTP checks across geographic regions, communicating via mTLS gRPC
- **Database (PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB)** - Time-series storage with automatic aggregation (1-minute, 1-hour, and 1-day intervals), P50/P95/P99 latency tracking, and uptime statistics

For detailed architecture documentation, see:
- [Control Plane Architecture](cmd/control-plane/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Worker Architecture](cmd/worker/ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Quick Start

Start the complete stack with one command:

```bash
task up
```

Then access:
- **Web UI**: http://localhost:3000
- **API**: https://localhost:8082

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Start Database**
   ```bash
   task db-up       # PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB
   task migrate-up  # Database migrations
   ```

2. **Start Services**
   ```bash
   task backend-up  # Control plane + workers
   task web-up      # Web interface
   ```

3. **Create Monitors**
   - Open http://localhost:3000
   - Sign up/sign in
   - Add monitors via the web interface

### Development Mode

For development with hot-reload:

```bash
task dev-full    # Full stack with live reload
```

### Common Commands

```bash
task logs              # View all service logs
task scale-workers N=3 # Scale workers
task psql              # Database CLI
task build             # Build images
task --list            # Show all available tasks
```
