# OpenSeer ‚Äî Distributed HTTP Monitoring

Self-hosted, horizontally scalable HTTP monitoring with a modern web interface. Multi-user support with secure authentication, real-time dashboards, and comprehensive monitoring management. Built with Go backend and TanStack Start frontend.

OpenSeer consists of four main components:

- **Web Frontend (TanStack Start)** - Modern dashboard with real-time metrics visualization, multi-user support with secure session-based authentication
- **Control Plane (Go)** - Service managing workers and job scheduling
- **Workers (Go)** - Distributed agents executing HTTP checks across geographic regions, communicating via mTLS gRPC
- **Database (PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB)** - Time-series storage with automatic aggregation (1-minute, 1-hour, and 1-day intervals), P50/P95/P99 latency tracking, and uptime statistics

For detailed architecture documentation, see:
- [Control Plane Architecture](cmd/control-plane/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Worker Architecture](cmd/worker/ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Quick Start

Use the Taskfile to prepare the database and bring everything up:

```bash
task migrate  # Runs auth + backend migrations sequentially
task up       # Starts TimescaleDB, control-plane, worker, and web services
```

Then access:
- **Web UI**: http://localhost:3000
- **API**: https://localhost:8082

### Operational Commands

- `task migrate` ‚Äî Ensures TimescaleDB is healthy, runs auth migrations, then backend migrations.
- `task up` ‚Äî Brings every service up via Docker Compose (app profile) and waits for health checks.
- `task down` ‚Äî Stops the stack and removes stray containers.
- `task clean` ‚Äî Stops the stack and deletes associated volumes for a fresh start.

After the stack is running, open http://localhost:3000, sign in, and manage monitors through the web UI.
